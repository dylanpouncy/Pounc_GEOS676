#Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Plugins - third party add-ons for time consuming and powerful functions

#Modules - are files that contain plain python code, definitions, and statements. Have a file extension of ".py". Everything completed o far is considered a module
#Used to organize code logically, useful to seperate similar functions and code into seperate modules

#Package - collection of special modules, modules that contain "__path__" attribute is considered a package. Popular packages includes numpy, scipy, math

#Library - is a term not synonymous with python typically, but commonly substituted for packages. Refers to a collection of modules

#Import - function used to 'import' new functionality, classes, data types, etc
#You can rename imported modules using the "as" keyword followed by the new name
#EX
import numpy as np
np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)

#from blank import blank - used to specify specific moduels or functions from a package, time saver if importing several large packages
#EX1
from numpy import * #Using * will import all modules and functions from a package, similar to select * in SQL
from numpy import ndarray #Only imports ndarray from numpy

#Creating a module - previously written python scripts can be implemented into new projects w/o copy + paste, using import
#EX1
#addition.py
def addNums(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)
#test.py
"""
from addition import addNums #wont run as the file is not called 'addition.py', could sub with 'Module6Notes.py'
x = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(addnums(x))
"""
#In above example, two modules called addition.py and test.py, we import functionality from addition.py into test.py w/o having to copy and paste

#Lambdas - short-hand function we can write in a single line and assign to a variable, also called anonymous functions. Useful for short function w/o having to set up a new definition
#EX1
isOdd = lambda num: num % 2
print(isOdd(6)) #prints 0m which means num was even
#Longer alternative
def isOdd(num):
    return num % 2
print(isOdd(6))

#Map - a way to apply a function to all members of a list, tuple, or set quickly. Can replace a loop or other iteration technique with one line of code
#EX1
x = [2, 3 ,4, 5 ,6, 7, 8]
squareEM = lambda num: num ** 2
y = list(map(squareEM, x))
z = map(squareEM, x)
print(y) #prints [4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]
print(z) #prints <map object at 0x000001EF315B2470> - this is the result of not turning our result into a list, which instead prints the location in memory of z

#Filter - type of map that only returns values that are true
#Boolean statements return False(0) or True(1)
#EX1 
x = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
y = list(filter(lambda num: num % 2 == 0, x)) #Serves as a conditional
z = list(filter(lambda num: num % 2, x))
print(y) #prints [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(z) #prints [3, 5, 7] #not conditional, cast as a boolean. Since an odd number has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, the 1 triggers the 'True' option and returns those values

#Reduce - a function used to quickly calculate a single number given a list of values. Provided a function and input list, reduce will run each value and return you a result
#EX1
from functools import reduce
x = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
add = lambda total, num: total + num #function takes two arguments: one being the result that is calculated and second being the input numbers. This lambda adds numbers to total
summation = reduce(add, x) #contains the call to reduce, takes two parameters: function used to calc and the input list
print(summation) #prints 35, calls the function once for each item in the input list, processes it using lambda, and in this case adds it to the total

#Generators - not technically functions like above, but generate values whenever called. Can be identified using their keyword yield instead of return
#Typically used to generate large data sets without allocating memory for all of the values or creating any functin so that it may be used in a for loop
#fib() - used to generate the fibonacci sequence
#EX1
def fib(n): #takes a single value that determines how many digits in the fib seq to print out
    a = b = 1
    for i in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
for x in fib(6):
    print(x) #prints 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 - This function yields the local variable a with every iteration, thereby printing out the sequence

#Arcpy Advanced Functions -

#Renderers - used by ArcGIS to determine how feature data gets drawn on the screen. Tells the program how the data should be presented to the user: 4 basic types. Not all layers support renderers, so check that the layer has a renderer attribute before trying
#Use supports() method of the 'layer' class to check if the layer supports renderers, will return a boolean value
#EX1

#SimpleRenderer - most basic and default, used to draw all features of a layer the same. Used when adding a feature class to a map, offers a plain all-one-color view

#UniqueValueRenderer - used to distinguish features in a feature layer based off of some classification, usually a data field. Given programmatic control over the type of field used in the classification of features as well as colors when drawing

#GraduatedColorsRenderer - used to render features in a feature layer based off of a specific field within the feature class. Can create chropleth maps programmatically, allows user to determine how many bins are present and colors

#GraduatedSymbolsRenderer - allows you to render features in a feature class depending on a number of bins. Used to create graduated symbol styled maps
